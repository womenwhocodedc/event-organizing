resources, links, guidance for WWC Leads to help them plan amazing events

##Event Type

###Schedule
How often you organize a WWC event is completely up to you and your availability. Here we are sharing what we've all learned around logistics, timing, and and other concerns that can help you put on an fantastic event.

*Even if you have a monthly meetup, the WWC DC guidance is you SHOULD NOT schedule auto-recurring events in Meetup.
*Organizing an event is a lot of work, if you have partners (shoot for at least 2!) it can really help you maintain the event.
*Post new events at least 2 weeks before, and no more than one month before.
*Check the WWC DC Meetup calendar, in Meetup.com, for any conflicts before you hit publish.
*Posting your idea for an event in the All-Leads channel on slack is highly recommended before you start a new type of event!

##Speakers

There's a couple ways you can find speakers for an event.
*Ask the WWC slack or meetup attendees if they have any recommendations (all-leads and maybe a channel around your specific topic)
*Check out We Speak Too http://wespeaktoo.org/cities/dc.html
*Check out DC Tech Speakers (and add yourself while you're at it!) https://github.com/dctech/speaking
